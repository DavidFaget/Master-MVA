# Title of the project: Variational autoencoders: graphical models for (semi) supervision
## Objective: study, critique, comment and implement the paper [1].

In the context of our project, we will specifically focus on the application of the proposed Characteristic
Capturing Variational Autoencoder (CCVAE) framework [1]. The paper introduces CCVAE as a novel model
that explicitly captures label characteristics in the latent space without directly associating label values with
latent variables.
In fact, the paper challenges the conventional approach to supervision in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
where labels are typically associated with a partially observed augmentation of the latent space zy. The
authors contend that this common practice may fall short in capturing the nuanced characteristic information
linked to labels.
