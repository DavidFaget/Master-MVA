# Introduction to Numerical Imaging - J. DELON,Y. GOUSSEAU
## Title of the project: Underwater image processing

The challenge of recovering accurate colors and
shapes in underwater scenes has prompted various imaging
techniques. Correcting colors in underwater images is crucial for
applications like 3D imaging and navigation. Existing methods,
not reliant on knowledge of physical parameters, utilize manual
adjustments or computational color constancy approaches. The
conventional gray-world hypothesis, rooted in achieving a gray
average image, proves inefficient in most cases. Consequently,
a pressing need arises for alternative algorithms and methods
to overcome these limitations. Thus, we will start by presenting
classical algorithms such as gray-world and white patch. Then,
we will present two more sophisticated algorithms: ACE and
All-in-One. Finally, we will compare all the studied algorithms.
