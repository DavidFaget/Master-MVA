class Agent(Protocol):
    """
    Defines an interface for agents in a simulation or decision-making environment.

    An Agent must implement methods to act based on observations, save its state to a file,
    and load its state from a file. This interface uses the Protocol class from the typing
    module to specify methods that concrete classes must implement.

    Protocols are a way to define formal Python interfaces. They allow for type checking
    and ensure that implementing classes provide specific methods with the expected signatures.

    def act(self, observation: np.ndarray, use_random: bool = False) -> int:
        """
        Determines the next action based on the current observation from the environment.

        Implementing this method requires processing the observation and optionally incorporating
        randomness into the decision-making process (e.g., for exploration in reinforcement learning).

        Args:
            observation (np.ndarray): The current environmental observation that the agent must use
                                       to decide its next action. This array typically represents
                                       the current state of the environment.
            use_random (bool, optional): A flag to indicate whether the agent should make a random
                                         decision. This is often used for exploration. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            int: The action to be taken by the agent.

        Saves the agent's current state to a file specified by the path.

        This method should serialize the agent's state (e.g., model weights, configuration settings)
        and save it to a file, allowing the agent to be later restored to this state using the `load` method.

        Args:
            path (str): The file path where the agent's state should be saved.

        Loads the agent's state from a file specified by the path (HARDCODED). This not a good practice,
        but it will simplify the grading process.

        This method should deserialize the saved state (e.g., model weights, configuration settings)
        from the file and restore the agent to this state. Implementations must ensure that the
        agent's state is compatible with the `act` method's expectations.

        Note:
            It's important to ensure that neural network models (if used) are loaded in a way that is
            compatible with the execution device (e.g., CPU, GPU). This may require specific handling
            depending on the libraries used for model implementation. WARNING: THE GITHUB CLASSROOM
        HANDLES ONLY CPU EXECUTION. IF YOU USE A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL, MAKE SURE TO LOAD IT IN A WAY THAT
        DOES NOT REQUIRE A GPU.
